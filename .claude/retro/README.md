# Retro

Tech debt and improvement opportunities surfaced by Claude during development.

Claude creates items here via the `create-retro-item` agent when it spots issues worth tracking. Each file is a fully-scoped story ready to execute.

To work through items:

- `ls .claude/retro/` to see the backlog
- "Hey Claude, pick something from .claude/retro/ and fix it"
- Delete the file when complete
