Tech debt and improvement opportunities surfaced by Claude during development.

Each file is a fully-scoped story ready to execute. To work through items:

- `ls .claude/retro/` to see the backlog
- "Hey Claude, pick something from .claude/retro/ and fix it"
- Delete the file or move to `.claude/retro/done/` when complete

Stories are prioritized by impact (Low, Medium, High, Critical) and sized by effort (S, M, L, XL).
