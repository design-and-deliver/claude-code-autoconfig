# Commit and Push

Stage all changes, create a commit with a good message, and push to the current branch.

## Steps

1. Stage all changes (`git add -A`)
2. Generate a conventional commit message based on the diff
3. Commit the changes
4. Push to the current branch

## Commit Message Format

Use conventional commits: `type(scope): description`

Types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore

Keep the subject line under 50 chars. Add body if the change needs explanation.
